One of our friends arrived first, and instead of seating her or at least welcoming her to wait at the table, the hostess questioned whether all six people were still coming. Since she wasn’t the one who made the reservation, she didn’t know, and because of that, they refused to seat her until the rest of us arrived. It felt odd and unaccommodating. The entire purpose of making a reservation is to ensure you have a table, so it was surprising that they wouldn’t let one member of the party be seated. What made the situation even more uncomfortable was that after refusing to seat her, the two staff members at the host stand began speaking to each other in another language about the situation, which came across as unprofessional and dismissive. The second issue happened at the end of the evening while we were paying. We explained...",

Food was good, but nothing wowed us, and one can easily find more value, taste and better presentation at other restaurants. For example their lobster pasta which I've heard great things about, came with tiny portions of lobster and the overall flavour was average. At $60+ I'd recommend you go to Savio Volpe for better quality pasta. We also tried several other dishes like their popular fried chicken (you could taste the grease), mushroom pizza (this was good), prawns in butter, cauliflower, etc. which were all good, but again not exceptional. For an almost $300 lunch we expected more and left underwhelmed.",

Our waitress—with long pink plastic nails and appearing to be of African descent—was inattentive and dismissive throughout. She never once checked in on us during the meal, yet we watched her engage with other tables multiple times. It felt like we were deliberately ignored. When we asked basic questions about the menu, her responses were condescending and unhelpful, which made my parents uncomfortable and frankly, embarrassed. We tried to remain patient, but the lack of courtesy and care was hard to ignore. It’s unfortunate because the food was decent, but the service completely overshadowed the meal. I rarely leave negative reviews, but this felt necessary. Hospitality matters—especially when families are trying to enjoy time together.",

At that point we had already decided on what we would be eating aswell, so ordered food at the same time. The server did not check up on us, maybe it was because only one alcoholic beverage was ordered? He continued to continuously check up on the table next to us that was ordering multiple beverages and he was also checking up on other tables. Luckily everything with our food was good, but it felt very discriminating how other tables were checked up on, but not ours.

The food and the staff are always excellent. It’s consistently a great experience. In the past, I’ve usually had a table on the patio, the first floor, or at the bar, and all of those were wonderful. However, my recent experience on the second floor at a small table facing the kitchen was noticeably less positive. The ventilation in that area doesn’t seem strong enough, and our clothes and skin absorbed a lot of the kitchen fumes. Sitting side by side also made it a bit awkward to have a conversation with my colleague. If this had been my first experience at Nightingale, I’m not sure I would have come back in the future.",

Food was good, but nothing wowed us, and one can easily find more value, taste and better presentation at other restaurants. For example their lobster pasta which I've heard great things about, came with tiny portions of lobster and the overall flavour was average. At $60+ I'd recommend you go to Savio Volpe for better quality pasta. We also tried several other dishes like their popular fried chicken (you could taste the grease), mushroom pizza (this was good), prawns in butter, cauliflower, etc. which were all good, but again not exceptional. For an almost $300 lunch we expected more and left underwhelmed.",
