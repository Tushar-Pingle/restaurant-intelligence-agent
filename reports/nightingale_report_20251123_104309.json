We understood this before we came in.\nOne of our party has an allergy to chilli, peppers and paprika, and we asked for a breakdown of what dishes she could have...the server (fantastic) quickly had this done and returned with a marked up menu. There were very few dishes that remained that were ok for her.\nMany of the dishes here come with a drizzle, a sauce or a dressing, which contain the allergy ingredient(s). We asked whether these sauces or sprinkles could be left to the side in a separate dish, but this was refused, meaning that she could only order 2 of the salads, and a couple of other dishes, most of which were not to her taste.\nWe feel that this complete lack of any flexibility (putting a sauce on the side rather than all over the dish is not a crazy modification, and is not normally an issue in other restaurants!) is very over the top and shows an unyielding arrogance, sadly, as it means that the vast majority of dishes aren't even orderable. (In a home style dining experience, you want to share lots of dishes between you all normally right!).\nBecause of the stress caused by this, we will not be returning to the Nightingale in future, and unless you are happy to not have any freedom to enable you to have more than an apple salad and a weird attempt at a lasagne, you should avoid it too!\n(The servers were excellent throughout and this is no reflection on them at all).",
