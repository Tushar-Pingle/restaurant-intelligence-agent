We were given a lovely semi-private dining room with a big table for the eight of us, and from our seats we could take in one of the most breathtaking views in Vancouver — overlooking Canada Place and the cruise ship terminal.\n\nThe food was exceptional — fresh, beautifully presented, and easily the best sushi experience I've had in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. Every dish felt like a little artwork on a plate. I ordered the Sable fish…a superb decision and a masterpiece presentation. The staff were wonderful — attentive without being overbearing, warm yet professional, and genuinely invested in making our day special.\n\nAfter 35 years in Vancouver, Miku has found its way right to the top of my list of favourite dining experiences. It's a place that manages to feel both elegant and comfortable — perfect for a celebration or a romantic meal. And considering the quality, the luncheon was very well priced and worth every single penny.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to management and staff.",

We were given a lovely semi-private dining room with a big table for the eight of us, and from our seats we could take in one of the most breathtaking views in Vancouver — overlooking Canada Place and the cruise ship terminal.\n\nThe food was exceptional — fresh, beautifully presented, and easily the best sushi experience I've had in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. Every dish felt like a little artwork on a plate. I ordered the Sable fish…a superb decision and a masterpiece presentation. The staff were wonderful — attentive without being overbearing, warm yet professional, and genuinely invested in making our day special.\n\nAfter 35 years in Vancouver, Miku has found its way right to the top of my list of favourite dining experiences. It's a place that manages to feel both elegant and comfortable — perfect for a celebration or a romantic meal. And considering the quality, the luncheon was very well priced and worth every single penny.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to management and staff.",
