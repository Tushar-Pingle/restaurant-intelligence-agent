From host reception to food selection and right down to the execution of their signature dishes, the experience is seamless. Perfect! My wife had the mushroom pasta, which she says is \"flavourful and a very generous portion\", while I had the crab cake. Having enjoyed the fresh seafood at The Chase and Kasa Moto (same company), I knew The Frederick would excel at creating delicious seafood dishes, and they certainly lived up to their standards. We shared the Dark Chocolate Cake, which was warm, rich, and decadent—not sweet or overpowering—which made for a very pleasant surprise. With a menu of classic comfort foods, we'll be coming back very soon, and I will have that legendary burger this time :) Thank you very much.",

My wife had the mushroom pasta, which she says is \"flavourful and a very generous portion\", while I had the crab cake. Having enjoyed the fresh seafood at The Chase and Kasa Moto (same company), I knew The Frederick would excel at creating delicious seafood dishes, and they certainly lived up to their standards. We shared the Dark Chocolate Cake, which was warm, rich, and decadent—not sweet or overpowering—which made for a very pleasant surprise. With a menu of classic comfort foods, we'll be coming back very soon, and I will have that legendary burger this time :) Thank you very much.",

The interior is warm and soothing. The atmosphere was great. Wine by the glass was reasonable. We have no hesitation in having a second glass. Food was very good with a good mix of sides. Attentiveness with a smile across the board is an absolute standout at The Frederick. The tipping prompt starts at 15% vs 18% for most places. One can clearly see that the management team is doing an amazing job. This is one place that other restaurants should take note of. Thank you for having us. We will definitely be back.",

We started the night with drinks and appetizers. We had the Frederick Rolls which was very good 8/10 and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ( a little bit over fried) but we were still able to taste the flavor 7/10. My husband had the Big Green Goddess Salad that was good too 8/10 and there was enough to save for his entre'. Our mains were Half Roasted Chicken ( BBQ-spiced, dry-cured) this was really good too, definitely 8/10 and the Campanelle & Braised Short Rib Pasta just great 8/10. Overall experience this establishment gets a 8/10 and I would highly recommend this restaurant!",

The vibes were 10/10, salt level minimal, taste level HIGH, and service excellent. If you go, ask to sit in Melanie’s section — she sets the standard for service, kindness, and genuine hospitality. What we ate: • Spinach artichoke dip • Short rib pasta • Miso salmon (the forbidden rice, seasoning, and glaze on the salmon were perfection — I have no words!) • Chocolate cake (absolutely worth the preorder and the wait) What we drank: • Prosecco (complimentary birthday treat from the restaurant) • Highland Heat (only minor miss — not quite enough heat for me) • Colleen had two non-alcoholic drinks that she loved • Mini espresso martinis (another complimentary treat) The Frederick calls itself an upscale bar and grill, ...",

We had a reservation for inside seating, but we changed to patio since the weather was pleasant. The staff kindly seated us at the bar while they set up our patio table. The interior is warm and soothing. The atmosphere was great. Wine by the glass was reasonable. We have no hesitation in having a second glass. Food was very good with a good mix of sides. Attentiveness with a smile across the board is an absolute standout at The Frederick. The tipping prompt starts at 15% vs 18% for most places. One can clearly see that the management team is doing an amazing job. This is one place that other restaurants should take note of. Thank you for having us. We will definitely be back.",

Having enjoyed the fresh seafood at The Chase and Kasa Moto (same company), I knew The Frederick would excel at creating delicious seafood dishes, and they certainly lived up to their standards. We shared the Dark Chocolate Cake, which was warm, rich, and decadent—not sweet or overpowering—which made for a very pleasant surprise.

We had a reservation for inside seating, but we changed to patio since the weather was pleasant. The staff kindly seated us at the bar while they set up our patio table. The interior is warm and soothing. The atmosphere was great. Wine by the glass was reasonable. We have no hesitation in having a second glass. Food was very good with a good mix of sides. Attentiveness with a smile across the board is an absolute standout at The Frederick. The tipping prompt starts at 15% vs 18% for most places.

We had a reservation for inside seating, but we changed to patio since the weather was pleasant. The staff kindly seated us at the bar while they set up our patio table. The interior is warm and soothing. The atmosphere was great. Wine by the glass was reasonable. We have no hesitation in having a second glass. Food was very good with a good mix of sides. Attentiveness with a smile across the board is an absolute standout at The Frederick. The tipping prompt starts at 15% vs 18% for most places. One can clearly see that the management team is doing an amazing job. This is one place that other restaurants should take note of. Thank you for having us. We will definitely be back.",
