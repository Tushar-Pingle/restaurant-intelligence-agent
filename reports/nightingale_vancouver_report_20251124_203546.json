One of our friends arrived first, and instead of seating her or at least welcoming her to wait at the table, the hostess questioned whether all six people were still coming. Since she wasn’t the one who made the reservation, she didn’t know, and because of that, they refused to seat her until the rest of us arrived. It felt odd and unaccommodating. The entire purpose of making a reservation is to ensure you have a table, so it was surprising that they wouldn’t let one member of the party be seated. What made the situation even more uncomfortable was that after refusing to seat her, the two staff members at the host stand began speaking to each other in another language about the situation, which came across as unprofessional and dismissive. The second issue happened at the end of the evening while we were paying. We explained...",

The food and the staff are always excellent. It’s consistently a great experience. In the past, I’ve usually had a table on the patio, the first floor, or at the bar, and all of those were wonderful. However, my recent experience on the second floor at a small table facing the kitchen was noticeably less positive. The ventilation in that area doesn’t seem strong enough, and our clothes and skin absorbed a lot of the kitchen fumes. Sitting side by side also made it a bit awkward to have a conversation with my colleague. If this had been my first experience at Nightingale, I’m not sure I would have come back in the future.",
