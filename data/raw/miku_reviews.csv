Jason,Dined 1 day ago,2,4,4,1,The food is good. The server is very attentive. But the noise level is so high. The manager is very rude. I was sitting at the counter. He’s banging the counter and talked kindly with other employees. It seriously ruined the otherwise very good dinner.,OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383

Kenneth,Dined 6 days ago,4,3,2,4,For being Michelin rated i was disappointed.  Staff left us with no water and drink for about 20 min.  Sushi was good but had better at less expensive places.,OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383
Jackie,Dined 7 days ago,4,4,5,4,"Had the Kaiseki. While the lobster ceviche course and all the sushi and sashimi was excellent, the sablefish and dessert were a real miss for me. The sablefish lacked flavour and the matcha opera cake was a pretty odd texture. The cake almost felt stale. 

The service was great, was seated immediately and well taken care of.",OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383

Ali,Dined 7 days ago,5,5,5,5,"We celebrated my daughter’s 22nd birthday dinner at Miku and stayed at the beautiful Pan Pacific hotel across the street. The service was impeccable, the food was absolutely delicious with stunning presentation, and the chef surprised us with a birthday seafood side dish that beat any cake we’ve ever been surprised with at any other restaurant! Haha. Definitely worth the Michelin star rating and would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting downtown Vancouver!!",OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383
Karen,"Dined on November 15, 2025",5,5,5,5,"Our lunches, veggie and sushi, were delicious. And the service was excellent, very friendly. The place is beautiful along with the view. 
The only negative is the chairs need to be replaced or stuffed as you sink uncomfortably into them.",OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383
Anh,"Dined on November 15, 2025",5,5,5,5,The ambiance is nice and the restaurant has a great view of the harbor. The sashimi is really fresh and nicely presented. The sushi is season just right so there's not a need to deep in soy sauce. Desert is wonderful and not too sweet. Would definitely come back with a bigger party to try out more items on the menu.,OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383

IVAN,"Dined on November 14, 2025",5,5,5,5,"Dining at Miku in Vancouver was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The service was attentive without being intrusive, and the atmosphere struck a perfect balance between elegance and warmth. Every dish showcased remarkable technique and freshness, especially the aburi sushi, which stood out for its exceptional flavor and texture.

The presentation reflected true attention to detail, and each bite felt like something special. The drink selection also deserves mention, as it paired beautifully with the meal.

Miku not only met expectations, it exceeded them. I would gladly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-tier dining experience in Vancouver.",OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383
Julia,"Dined on November 14, 2025",5,5,5,4,"The food was fantastic, and our waiter’s recommendations were spot-on. We also had a great table for celebrating my birthday.

Joao,"Dined on November 13, 2025",2,5,1,2,"Good evening,

I made a reservation at your restaurant today through OpenTable for 9:00 p.m. I arrived about five minutes early and waited at the reception for at least another seven to ten minutes before anyone came to assist me. When I mentioned that I had a reservation through OpenTable for a table, I was asked if I would mind sitting at the bar instead. I politely reiterated that I had specifically chosen a table in order to have a pleasant dining experience.

Eventually, I was shown to a table, where I waited another ten minutes before the waitress came over with the menu and wine list. I explained that, since it was my first time at the restaurant, I would like to start by ordering the appetizers, and then choose the wines accordingly, depending on how the dishes paired.

About ten minutes after my delicious first course had arrived, and after I had selected the first sparkling wine to pair with it, the waitress informed me that I should choose my second course right away, as the kitchen was about to close and only desserts would soon be available. I pointed out that I had made my reservation for 9:00 p.m., and yet I was being told this at 9:30 p.m.

I explained that this was not the kind of experience I was expecting—especially from a restaurant recommended by the Michelin Guide. She replied, somewhat curtly, that she didn’t make the rules but that the kitchen closed at 9:30 p.m. I asked to speak with the manager, who, after I explained the situation, told me it had been a communication mistake and assured me that my dining experience would be properly taken care of.

I ordered a second appetizer and, after tasting it, selected a wine to pair with it, which took another ten minutes to arrive. At this point, it is important to note that the waitstaff seemed lost and disorganized; they did not make eye contact with guests, and we had to constantly gesture to get their attention. This is a basic expectation of good service and was completely lacking.

Finally, f",OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383

Dan,"Dined on November 8, 2025",3,3,3,5,"We’ve been many times - the sushi and lamb chops were outstanding , as always.  However the potatoes accompanying the lamb looked beautiful but were cold as ice.  The Brussel sprout chips  were giant Brussel sprouts not cooked through- the best part is the crispy chips and there were very few- unlike any time I have had them in the past.  The bar service was mediocre - again unlike the table service experienced in the past.",OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383

Love the aburi.  Wish we could afford to order more of the unagi sushi, but the price is getting a bit steep IMO - delicious,  but hard to justify.
Service was friendly enough, and a nice setting.

Leslie,"Dined on October 19, 2025",5,5,5,5,"My first visit to Miku turned into something truly memorable — a special occasion shared with my children, their partners, and dear friends visiting from South Africa and London. We were given a lovely semi-private dining room with a big table for the eight of us, and from our seats we could take in one of the most breathtaking views in Vancouver — overlooking Canada Place and the cruise ship terminal.

The food was exceptional — fresh, beautifully presented, and easily the best sushi experience I’ve had in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. Every dish felt like a little artwork on a plate. I ordered the Sable fish…a superb decision and a masterpiece presentation. The staff were wonderful — attentive without being overbearing, warm yet professional, and genuinely invested in making our day special.

After 35 years in Vancouver, Miku has found its way right to the top of my list of favourite dining experiences. It’s a place that manages to feel both elegant and comfortable — perfect for a celebration or a romantic meal. And considering the quality, the luncheon was very well priced and worth every single penny.

A heartfelt thank you to management and staff.",OpenTable,2025-11-23 05:15:08.757383
